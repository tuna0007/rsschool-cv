##### ABOUT ME
The solar eclipse of October 25, 2022 brought into my life an understanding of what I want to do for the rest of my days.
Currently, I'm creating websites for my portfolio & improving my knowledge of JS. I've also started the Front-end course by RSS. 
In January I'm going to enroll in a distant professional retraining program at Moscow State University to become a programmer with a diploma.
